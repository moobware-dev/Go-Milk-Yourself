# Go Milk Yourself

## Just you, your udders, and a bucket.  You know what to do...

This thing started as a hackathon project for fun and I think it's small enough it could help someone learn Unity3D and it's weird enough that will be entertaining as well.  I'm streaming development of this game on Twitch at [moobware_dev](https://www.twitch.tv/moobware_dev), hop on over there and you can learn and/or make suggestions!  The code is here so you can run it and extend it if you want..
